Constraints:

    You are only allowed to use Box and Text from @chakra-ui/react.

    You can use the existing Lucide icons already in the codebase (e.g., HomeIcon, Sofa, etc.).

    Do not use Tailwind CSS or any other Chakra UI components (e.g., no VStack, HStack, Image, Button, etc.).

    Keep the structure flexible and responsive using only the allowed components.

    Focus on layout, spacing, typography, and visual clarity.

I’d like you to:

You can only use Box and Text from @chakra-ui/react — no other components or external styling libraries.

Make it look clean, modern, and compelling.
